# Phyzios Recompilation Project
Reconstructed source code of the legendary Phyzios Studio Pro

About
-

Phyzios Studio is a long-lost particle based physics sandbox made by Promotech, Inc.

By using a particle-based approach to solving physics, it is capable of detailed soft body, fluid, and rigid based effects.

Phyzios Studio is the successor to OE-Cake. In addition to all of the complex and dynamic emergent behavior that defined OE-Cake, Phyzios has the addition of powerful quality of life changes, game engine enhancements, and improved tools.
